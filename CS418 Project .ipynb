    "## Project Introduction\n",
    "In it's current form, the main idea of this project is to see if a clustering method can be used to subdivide a large pool of songs that are deemed to be part of the same genre into smaller subgenres. A potential audience for this analysis would be people who are trying to get into a new gerne. Being able to listen to a selection of songs from each subgroup could make it easier to figure out what type of bands they'd enjoy listening to. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our preliminary exploration into this topic we decided to use a precompiled [dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/classic-rock/classic-rock-song-list.csv) of classic rock songs and get their audio features via spotify's API. We decided to use rock as our genre for this because it is one of the broadest genres of music with many distinct characteristic sounds and sub-cultures. If the preliminary results are fruitful we may continue on to broadening the genres we cluster from."

    "## Changes to Scope of Project\n",
    "### Spotify Listening Trends Based on Time of Year\n",
    "   Originally, our project was going to focus on the songs that gain popularity at different times of the year. We wondered if there was some correspondence between the properties of those songs and the time at which they reached peak popularity and see if we could predict the optimal time of year to release a new song given its properties.\n",
    "   Our course of action was to fetch the top 100 songs from the Billboard charts every week of the year for the past 20 years. We would then retrieve the songs' properties using the Spotify API and organize the data for comparison and use machine learning to develop a way of classifying a song into seasons based on its properties.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   We decided to change our project's scope for a few reasons. When we examined the properties of the songs we gathered, virtually every week had a wide variety of levels of energy, key, loudness, etc. We concluded that there wasn't significance in the seasonality of the songs and that would likely lead to an inaccurate classification model. Since the hot-100 charts features songs of all varieties, we decided we'd have to hone in on a type of music to make the properties of the songs more similar. Additionally, a song that is on the Billbord hot-100 list often remains on the list for weeks, or even months. This resulted in complications in identifying the season that the song gained popularity, and would likely affect the learning.\n",
